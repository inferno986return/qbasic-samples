# qbasic-samples
Mirror of public-domain sample QBasic programs found on [The Dubber](http://thedubber.altervista.org/dmg8bit/qbasic.htm).

This repository includes the original four sample programs:

* *Gorilla* - An artillery game similar to Worms, but where the gravity, angle and velocity have to be defined by the player using the keyboard.
* *Money* - A simple finance program.
* *Nibbles* - A Snake-like game.
* *RemLine* - Removes the line numbers from old BASIC code.

QBasic is a dialect of BASIC owned by Microsoft making it a predecessor to VisualBasic. To run these programs you'll need a QBasic interpreter. An interpreter can be run on FreeDOS though I recommend DOSBox with [QBasic.net's IDE and compiler](http://www.qbasic.net/en/qbasic-downloads/compiler/qbasic-compiler.htm), I managed to get Gorilla and Nibbles working though there are issues with speed on default settings, so slow it down with Alt+F7.

Alternatively I suggest remaking some of the games in a modern game engine such as Godot or from scratch. GNOME Nibbles has started this.
