# qbasic-samples
Mirror of public-domain sample QBasic programs found on [The Dubber](http://thedubber.altervista.org/dmg8bit/qbasic.htm).

This repository includes the original four sample programs:

* Gorilla - An artillery game similar to Worms, but where the gravity, angle and velocity have to be defined by the player using the keyboard.
* Money - A simple finance program.
* Nibbles - A Snake-like game.
* RemLine - Removes the line numbers from old BASIC code.

QBasic is a dialect of BASIC owned by Microsoft making it a predecessor to VisualBasic. To run these programs you'll need a QBasic interpreter, FreeDOS has one.

Alternatively I suggest remaking some of the games in a modern game engine such as Godot. GNOME Nibbles has started this.
